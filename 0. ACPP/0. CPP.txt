CPP Topics to be practised and prepared
----------------------------------------
1. Inheritance
    - Public, private inheritance
    - Is-a relation, has-a relation, composition, aggregation
2. Polymorphism
    - Creating interfaces and using them
    - defining concrete classes and accessing them
    - casting between objects
    - virtual function and behaviour of ctor and dtor
3. Templates
    - Normal template usage
    - template specialization
    - SFINAE
    - metaprogramming
4. Friend functions
    - class , function
    - mutual friendship?
5. Optimization
    - constexpr, templates ( compile time resolution)
    - memory optimization
6. memeory management
    - smart pointers and their implementations
    - how they internaly work ?
7. Variables and usage
    - using pass by value, pass by reference, const
    - using const, decltype other directives at functions
8. Structures & operations
9. STL
    - vector, map, tuple and using them
10. std::optional , std::enable if
11. type traits
12. Exception handling - custom exceptions, checked and unchecked exceptions ( autosar cpp guidelines)
13. multithreading and syncronization
    - lock_guard, unique_lock
    - condition variables
    - calling class members from thread , or using as thread function
14. lamda functions
15. Pointers
16. String and std::string operations / implementaion
17. pragma
18. what are deleters , how deleters can be used in templates.
19. Macros usage.


System understanding & cpp internals
----------------------------------------
1. What is heap ?
2. What is stack trace ? what element / pointer used to represent stack.  ----------vvi
3. what concepts in c++ can be used for better memeory management
4. explain std move. how std move is implemented underneath.
5. design patterns and anti design patterns
6. design principles, SOLID
7. advanatages of using smart pointers


Generic
------------
1. Gtest, coverity
2. Usage of git , gerrit
3. static, dyn libs, executables.
4. Debugging - gdb, using tools like addr2line, nm, readelf etc
5. Given a program identify what UT can be written, what all does it cover ( boundary conditions etc)
